## Summary

<!-- Brief description of changes -->

## PR Title Format

<!--
Your PR title MUST follow Conventional Commits format:

  <type>(<scope>): <description>

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
Scopes (optional): base, dev, cli, web-ui, docs, deps

Examples:
  feat(cli): add interactive mode
  fix(web-ui): resolve fullscreen diagram issue
  docs: update installation guide
  chore(deps): bump mermaid to v11

This is enforced by CI and the PR title becomes the squashed commit message.
