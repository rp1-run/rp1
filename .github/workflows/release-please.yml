# Release Please - Versioning & Changelog Automation
#
# Rolling Release PR Strategy:
# - One open release PR always exists, accumulating changes
# - Every merged PR updates the release PR (changelog, version bump)
# - NO release happens until the release PR itself is merged
# - Merging the release PR triggers: tag creation, GitHub release, artifact builds
#
# This workflow handles:
# - Semantic versioning via conventional commits
# - Changelog generation
# - Release PR creation and maintenance
# - OpenCode artifact builds (only on actual release)
#
# Binary distribution (rp1 CLI) is handled separately by goreleaser.yml,
# which triggers on the tag created by this workflow.
#
# Note: CI checks (lint, typecheck, tests) run in ci.yml workflow.
# Use branch protection rules to require CI to pass before merging.
