# Release Please - Versioning & Changelog Automation
#
# This workflow handles:
# - Semantic versioning via conventional commits
# - Changelog generation
# - Release PR creation and tagging
# - OpenCode artifact builds
#
# Binary distribution (rp1 CLI) is handled separately by goreleaser.yml,
# which triggers on the tag created by this workflow.
