# Hypothesis Validator

This command invokes the **hypothesis-tester** agent to validate design assumptions for a feature.

Use the Task tool to invoke the hypothesis-tester agent:

```
subagent_type: rp1-dev:hypothesis-tester
```

The agent will:
- Load the hypotheses.md document for the specified feature
- Parse all PENDING hypotheses
- Validate each using code experiments, codebase analysis, or external research
- Document findings with evidence and implications
- Update hypothesis status to CONFIRMED or REJECTED
- Clean up any temporary artifacts
- Report validation summary

**Prerequisites**:
- A `hypotheses.md` file must exist at `.rp1/work/features/{feature-id}/hypotheses.md`
- This file is typically generated by the feature-design command when high-risk assumptions are identified

**Usage**:
```
/rp1-dev:validate-hypothesis my-feature
```
